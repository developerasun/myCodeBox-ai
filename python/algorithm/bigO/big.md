# Big O notation - function's degree

n: how many inputs are given
T(n) : times needed to process the input(n)

A graph can be drawn with : x axis - n, y axis - T(n)
In the graph, each algorithm's speed can be compared by looking at T(n)s, 
which sets by the same input(n) value.

Limit n -> infinite : all thrown but function degree -> Notated as O(function degree)
    * O(n^2) is slower than O(n)
    * O(n) is slower than O(logn)
    * O(logn) is slower than O(1)
